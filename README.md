# CSV2VCF
A python code to convert each row of a csv file to individual vcf files.

Useful in situations where you have to save contacts frm your google contacts to old phones which support only vcf files.
You just need to export the contacts in form of csv and place the path for the code to create separate vcf files for each row 
of contact in csv.
The code creates VCF of Version 2.1
